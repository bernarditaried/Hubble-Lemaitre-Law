# Hubble-Lemaitre-Law
In this tutorial, we will reproduce Hubble's 1929 results and introduce the least squares method.

I also recorded a video explaining the jupyter notebook, both in [English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1EIhHgserE) and [Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL3Q_zjytqs) :)
